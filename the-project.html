				<p>IncluCity is a partnership between the Digital Society School, Delfshaven Digital, De Middellander Het Wijkbedrijf, 
					and Stichting CAATS. The project is to be developed and tested in Middelland, a neighborhood located in Rotterdam. We intend to 
				implement the platform throughout the city after testing and, when that is succesful, then implement it nationally and globally.</p>
				<p>We chose Middelland as a starting point, because the neighbourhood was already quite active, making it easier to contact groups of residents
					through existing initiatives. The core of action in Middelland was the co-creation programme Mooi, Mooier, Middelland. The Mooi, Mooier, Middelland 
					process is about building stronger and more resilient communities. It is a leading example in the Netherlands for new forms of local democracy and 
					structural co-creation. Due to the fact that initiatives like these are already present and active within Middelland we thought it would be best to 
					start there so we could collaborate and support each other in our goal to build a inclusive, resilient community. After all, many hands make light work.

				<p>After team and project allocations, the team started brainstorming and making rough sketches of 
					their idea based on the briefing and the introduction with the partners. During this sprint, 
					the team began participating in workshops and doing their respective research to kickstart their user research 
					and conversational object. The object was also a way as well to gather insights and act as a springboard for the prototype, 
					and instigate interest for the Showcase last September 17.</p>
