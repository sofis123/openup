				<p>We are a team of four members who are Designers and Researchers. We are passionate about creating
					viable solutions towards a future that aligns with the UN sustainable development goals. Thus, the
					centre of our research and design have been tailored to address
					<br>
					Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
					<br>
					Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
					<br>
					Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
					<br>Goal 17: Partnership for the Goals
					<br>Together with Delfshaven Digital, CAAT, as trainees at DSS Hogeschool van Amsterdam, we worked
					on a project called "______”. With the hopes of creating a resilient and inclusive neighborhood,
					"______” connects residents together through a digital platform where they can discover their
					strengths, interest, and share their stories.
					<br>How can we create interaction among different residents in a fun and engaging way? We can
					unravel our talents and find opportunities in our own neighborhoods.
					<br>If you any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>
